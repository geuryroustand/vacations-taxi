          <p>
            Taxis are readily available at the airport and are a popular option for travelers.
            However, it is essential to negotiate the fare before getting in the car, as the prices
            are not regulated. Another option is to use a shuttle service, which is often less
            expensive than a taxi and can be pre-booked before your arrival. Private car services
            are also available and provide a more luxurious and personalized experience but at a
            higher cost. Lastly, rental cars are available at the airport, but it is important to
            note that driving in Punta Cana can be challenging due to the lack of road signs and
            aggressive drivers.
