      "If you are looking for quality, dependable transportation to anywhere in the Dominican Republic, this is the company you want to call first. They provide excellent communication throughout the entire trip to and from the country from anywhere in the world. Their drivers are courteous and helpful...making sure that they are on time to pickup and deliver you to your destination. Their prices are very reasonable and you will know that you are getting VIP service. Be sure and ask for Daniel Kelly.",

      "We took DAT to and from the hotel. Both times they were awaiting us and clearly sought us out. The drivers were friendly and very helpful. Guido even pointed out things as we drove. They had water and cervesos for us - ice cold. We will use them again. The rate was very reasonable as well. There were 8 of us and everyone was thrilled with the cleanliness and comfort of the van. The best part, both were extremely safe drivers and I am usually very skeptical about drivers in foreign countries. I felt very safe.",
